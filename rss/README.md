# RSS Bridge

The [RSS feed poller](rss/README.md) is a command line tool that can be used to
retrieve real-time news and blog posts from any RSS feed. The tool can be
configured with a list of RSS feed URLs or OPML files, and it will poll the
feeds at a configurable interval. The RSS client will only forward new items
from the feeds.
